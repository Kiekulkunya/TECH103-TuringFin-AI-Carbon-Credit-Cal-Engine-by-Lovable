                    The CarbonCalc calculator uses industry-standard methodologies to estimate potential carbon credits for cleantech companies.
                    Our calculations are based on several key factors:

                  <p>
                    Carbon credits are tradable permits representing the right to emit a specific amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. 
                    One carbon credit represents one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent that is either removed from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    For cleantech companies, carbon credits represent an additional revenue stream and validation of environmental benefits. 
                    They are generated through projects that reduce, remove, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The carbon credit market helps finance projects that might otherwise not be financially viable, accelerating the transition to a 
                    lower-carbon economy by putting a price on carbon emissions.
